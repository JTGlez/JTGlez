# 💻 Tech Stack:

I’m a Full-Stack Developer with a focus on backend development. My skill set includes frontend development with JavaScript/TypeScript, using frameworks such as React and Next.js. On the backend, I have experience working in both monolithic and microservices architectures using Python, Scala, and Go, with libraries like Apache Kafka, Argo Workflows, the Typelevel ecosystem (Cats/Cats-Effect), Flask, FastAPI, Kopf, sttp Ember, and GraphQL (Sangria/Caliban).

I am also proficient in using both ORMs and parameterized SQL queries in environments like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, RQLite, and OracleDB. In the DevOps field, I have hands-on experience with containerization technologies such as Docker and Podman, as well as developing distributed applications with Kubernetes and Kind. I'm also skilled in deploying applications on Vercel and Amazon Web Services, using services like Route 53, Elastic Beanstalk, S3, and EC2.
